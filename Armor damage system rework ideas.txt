Damage attributes?
	Penetration - reduces effectiveness of armor.

Armor attributes?
	Hardness - reduces damage from damage?

Attributes could be combined into a coeffecient.
	High damage coeffecient = armor has less effect.
	High armor coeffecient = damage has less effect.
	Coeffecients should (approximately) cancel out.
	If 30% of damage is mitigated with a coeffecient of 1, then 60% should be mitigated at 2. Either caps at 100% or is applied hyperbolically.

Implementation details:
	Can optionally have a base damage / armor type that the effect is added on top of. Whole families of types possible.
	Basic types (ex: MultiplierDamageType) contains a list of damage / armor types and multipliers.
	Composite (ex: CompositeDamageType) types that combine damage / armor types and aggregates results with min, max, multiply, or avarage.
	Has identifier and display name. Printing name of type combines names through three. Ex Anti-Armor gun = "Gun, Anti-Armor" or Heavy armor = "Armor, Heavy"
	Increased complexity could lead to performance issues, consider caching options.
		Damage, Armor types could be marked as cacheable, if both in interaction is cachable, then cache. This should be all described here.
		Cache stored somewhere common as a dict, but which key should be used? For optimal performance, key should have a good hash. Perhaps use HashCode.Combine(field1, field2); 
		
	Perhaps create a simple conversion script from current dict-based approach to new system.

ComputeDamage(DamageInfo info, DamageType damage, ArmorType armor) {
	damage.ModifyDamage(info)
	armor.MitigateDamage(info)
}

armor types:
	Infantry - Low resistance against gun. Analogous to fabrics, thin metals, generally person-carriable materials.
		Kevlar - Increased resistance against gun.
		Flak - Increased resistance against rocket, cannon, particularily explosive.
		Ceramic - Increased coeffecient.
	Armor - Resistance against gun damage. Analogous to thick panels of steel or other metals.
		Light - Vulnurable to rocket, but resistent against energy. Less resistent to gun.
		Medium - Vulnurable to cannon, but highly resistent to gun.
		Heavy - Vulnurable to energy, but impervious to gun, resistent to cannon, and highly resistent to to rocket.
	Shield - Resistance against energy damage, but vulnurable to kinetic particularily gun.

damage types: 
	Gun - High damage against infantry, low against armor.
		Hollow-Point - Bonus against infantry, but worse against armor.
		Full Metal Jacket - Mid against inf, mid against armor.
		Anti-Armor - Decreased damage against infantry, but stronger against armor.
		Explosive - Bonus damage to light armor.

	Rocket - High damage against light armor.
		Flak - Bonus damage against aircraft.

	Cannon - High damage against medium armor.
		Squash Head - Reduced damage against armor, but increased against infantry and light.
		Armor Piercing - Incresed coeffecient.

	Explosive - High damage against infantry, structures, low against armor. This is the current "Grenade" damage.
	Fire - High damage against infantry, structures, extremely low against armor.
		Plasma - Combination of Fire and Energy

	Energy - Effective against heavy armor, reduced damage against lighter armors. Neglible damage to shields.
		Tesla - Swap damage between infantry and heavy. Bonus damage to shields.
