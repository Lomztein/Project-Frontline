THE SHROOMIE FACTION

THE SHROOMS ARE TIRED OF HUMAN CRIMES AGAINST NATURE, AND SO THEY HAVE DECIDED TO FIGHT THE HUMANS HEAD ON. TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENTIENT MUSHROOM COLONY AND WAGE WAR UPON EVERYONE ELSE IN A BID FOR WORLD DOMINATION, SO THAT NATURE CAN RECLAIM THE WORLD. THEY HAVE STOLEN WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM THEIR FIRST VICTIMS, AND NOW SEEK TO TURN IT AGAINST THE REST.
