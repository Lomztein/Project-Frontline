Balanced - "Default", uses whatever units appear to be the best fits. (Implemented)
Heavy - Similar to balanced, but prioritizes units by health and armor. (Current tanker, remove current steamroller)
Tech - Similar to balanced, but prioritizes units by tech level and cost
Turtle - Focus on eco and defense early game, then transitions to producing units late-game.
Bombardier - Focus on long range units that can bombard the enemy from afar
Light - Similar to balanced, but prioritizes units by their cost relative to income
Aircraft - Focus on defenses and eco if it can't produce air units, but otherwise a whole lotta aircraft.
Infantry - Balanced, but prioritizes infantry
Vehicle - Balanced, but prioritizes infantry
Optimized - Largely random, but uses the effeciency tracker to decide on what to place more of.

Implement a "Base AI" that has weights for counters, healing units, siege breaker, upgrade, defence, anti air, shield, and point defense, and economy.
This should handle all base functionality that most AI's should have.

Features to add / upgrade
Income tracker, tracks approximate income over time
Effeciency tracker, tracks the "effeciency" of a unit by comparing their kill how much they earn from kills with how much money they grant the enemy.
Allow AI to save up for units based on approximate income

Weight tables to implement
DefenseWeightTable - Prioritizes defense units when on the defense.
SiegeBreakerWeightTable - Prioritzies siege units when siegeing for a while
HarraserWeightTable - Prioritizes harraser units when sieged for a while
AntiAirWeightTable - Prioritizes anti-air units if the enemy has a comparatively large amount of air units.
	How to determine if unit is anti-air? Unit tags maybe?
